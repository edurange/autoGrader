If no expression is given%% the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead%% anyway).[m<NL>[22;1H[m<NL>[23;1H       This  manual  page  talks  about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of [1mfind[0m but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real'[m<NL>[24;1H       options [1m-H[0m%% [1m-L[0m%% [1m-P[0m%% [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m must appear before the first path name%% if at all.  A double dash [1m--[0m can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though  ensuring[m<NL>[25;1H       that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).[m<NL>[26;1H[m<NL>[27;1H       -P     Never  follow  symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information a file%% and the file is a symbolic link%% the information used shall be taken[m<NL>[28;1H              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.[m<NL>[29;1H[m<NL>[30;1H       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files%% the information used shall be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points%% not  from[m<NL>[31;1H              the  link  itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or [1mfind[0m is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this option implies [1m-noleaf[0m.  If you later use the [1m-P[0m[m<NL>[32;1H              option%% [1m-noleaf[0m will still be in effect.  If [1m-L[0m is in effect and [1mfind[0m discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search%% the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link[m<NL>[33;1H              will be searched.[m<NL>[34;1H[m<NL>[35;1H              When  the  [1m-L[0m option is in effect%% the [1m-type[0m predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic[m<NL>[36;1H              link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while [1mfind[0m is executing (for example [1m-delete[0m) can give rise to confusing behaviour.   Using  [1m-L[0m  causes  the[m<NL>[37;1H              [1m-lname[0m and [1m[7m-i[27m[0m[1mlname[0m predicates always to return false.[m<NL>[38;1H[m<NL>[39;1H       -H     Do not follow symbolic links%% except while processing the command line arguments.  When [1mfind[0m examines or prints information about files%% the information used shall be taken from the[m<NL>[40;1H              properties of the symbolic link itself.   The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link%% and the link can  be  resolved.   For[m<NL>[41;1H              that  situation%%  the information used is taken from whatever the link points to (that is%% the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the[m<NL>[42;1H              file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If [1m-H[0m is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory%%  the  contents  of[m<NL>[43;1H              that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).[m<NL>[44;1H[m<NL>[45;1H       If  more  than one of [1m-H[0m%% [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m is specified%% each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it is the default%% the [1m-P[0m option should be con-[m<NL>[46;1H       sidered to be in effect unless either [1m-H[0m or [1m-L[0m is specified.[m<NL>[47;1H[m<NL>[48;1H       GNU [1mfind[0m frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself%% before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how those arguments  are  processed.   Specifi-[m<NL>       cally%%  there  are  a  number of tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.  In each case%% the file specified on the command line will[m<NL>       have been examined and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link%% and the [1m-P[0m option is in effect (or if neither [1m-H[0m nor [1m-L[0m were  specified)%%[m<NL>       the  information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise%% it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points to.  If [1mfind[0m[m<NL>       cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.[m<NL>[m<NL>       When the [1m-H[0m or [1m-L[0m [1moptions[0m [1mare[0m [1min[0m [1meffect%%[0m [1many[0m [1msymbolic[0m [1mlinks[0m [1mlisted[0m as the argument of [1m-newer[0m will be dereferenced%% and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the symbolic  link[m<NL>       points.  The same consideration applies to [1m-newerXY[0m%% [1m-anewer[0m and [1m-cnewer[0m.[m<NL>[m<NL>       The  [1m-follow[0m  option has a similar effect to [1m-L[0m%% though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is%% if [1m-L[0m is not used but [1m-follow[0m is%% any symbolic links appearing after [1m-follow[0m[m<NL>       on the command line will be dereferenced%% and those before it will not).[m<NL>[m<NL>       -D debugoptions[m<NL>              Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why [1mfind[0m is not doing what you want.
