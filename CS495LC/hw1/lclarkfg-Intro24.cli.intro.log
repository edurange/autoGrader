GNU [1mfind[0m searches the directory tree rooted at each given[m<NL>       starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right%% according to  the  rules  of  precedence[m<NL>       (see  section OPERATORS)%% until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for [4mand[24m operations%% true for[m<NL>       [4mor[24m)%% at which point [1mfind[0m moves on to the next file name.

Command-line arguments following these are[m<NL>       taken  to  be  names of files or directories to be examined%% up to the first argument that begins with `-'%% or[m<NL>       the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression  describing[m<NL>       what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given%% the current directory is used.  If no expression is given%%[m<NL>       the expression [1m-print[0m is used (but you should probably consider using [1m-print0[0m instead%% anyway).[m<NL>[m<NL>       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options  control  the  behaviour  of[m<NL>       [1mfind[0m  but  are  specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options [1m-H[0m%% [1m-L[0m%% [1m-P[0m%% [1m-D[0m and [1m-O[0m[m<NL>       must appear before the first path name%% if at all.  A double dash [1m--[0m can also  be  used  to  signal  that  any[m<NL>       remaining  arguments  are  not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is[m<NL>       generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).[m<NL>[m<NL>       -P     Never follow symbolic links.

Using [1m-L[0m causes the [1m-lname[0m  and  [1m-ilname[0m  predicates  always  to[m<NL>              return false.[m<NL>[m<NL>       -H     Do  not  follow symbolic links%% except while processing the command line arguments.

The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command line[m<NL>              is a symbolic link%% and the link can be resolved.  For that situation%% the information  used  is  taken[m<NL>              from  whatever  the  link  points  to  (that is%% the link is followed).  The information about the link[m<NL>              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If [1m-H[0m  is[m<NL>              in  effect  and  one  of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory%% the[m<NL>              contents of that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).[m<NL>[m<NL>       If more than one of [1m-H[0m%% [1m-L[0m and [1m-P[0m is specified%% each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the  com-[m<NL>       mand  line  takes  effect.

The [1mfind[0m program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving[m<NL>              the overall effect; that is%% predicates with side effects are not reordered  relative  to  each  other.[m<NL>              The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.[m<NL>[m<NL>              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.[m<NL>[m<NL>              1      This  is  the  default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expres-[m<NL>                     sions are reordered so that tests based only on the  names  of  files  (for  example  [1m-name[0m  and[m<NL>                     [1m-regex[0m) are performed first.[m<NL>[m<NL>              2      Any  [1m-type[0m  or  [1m-xtype[0m tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files%% but[m<NL>                     before any tests that require information from the inode.  On many modern versions of Unix%% file[m<NL>                     types  are  returned by [1mreaddir()[0m and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than predicates[m<NL>                     which need to stat the file first.  If you use the [1m-fstype[0m [4mFOO[24m predicate and specify a  filesys-[m<NL>                     tem  type [4mFOO[24m which is not known (that is%% present in `/etc/mtab') at the time [1mfind[0m starts%% that[m<NL>                     predicate is equivalent to [1m-false[0m.[m<NL>[m<NL>              3      At this optimisation level%% the full cost-based query optimiser is enabled.  The order of  tests[m<NL>                     is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more expensive ones are per-[m<NL>                     formed later%% if necessary.  Within each cost band%% predicates are evaluated  earlier  or  later[m<NL>                     according  to whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For [1m-o[0m%% predicates which are likely to[m<NL>                     succeed are evaluated earlier%% and for [1m-a[0m%% predicates which are likely  to  fail  are  evaluated[m<NL>                     earlier.[m<NL>[m<NL>              The  cost-based  optimiser  has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases[m<NL>              the probability takes account of the specific nature of the test (for example%% [1m-type[0m [1mf[0m is assumed to be[m<NL>              more  likely  to succeed than [1m-type[0m [1mc[0m).  The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.   If it[m<NL>              does not actually improve the performance of [1mfind[0m%% it will be removed again.  Conversely%% optimisations[m<NL>              that  prove to be reliable%% robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.[m<NL>              However%% the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed  in  the  4.3.x  release[m<NL>              series.   The  findutils  test  suite runs all the tests on [1mfind[0m at each optimisation level and ensures[m<NL>              that the result is the same.[m<NL>[m<NL>[1mEXPRESSION[0m[m<NL>       The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the [4mexpression[24m.  This is  a  kind  of  query[m<NL>       specification describing how we match files and what we do with the files that were matched.
